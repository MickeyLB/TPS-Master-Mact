# TPS-Master

This is the TPS Promotions &amp; Incentives Master GitHub Repository for the SuiteCloud SDK Account Customization Projects. The "root" branch will be protected and hold only an empty SuiteCloud SDF Account Customization Project from which
feature branches may be created. There will then be branches for each of the 5 accounts (Production, Sandbox, Dev Account 0, Dev Account 1, and Dev Account 2).
